-: LULD:

	- If I had to quickly explain it: a mechanism that helps to control market volatility by calculating reference prices
	  and price bands that define trades that are executable.

	- One of the questions I had: there seem to be volatility you want to protect against, such as panicky trades or momentum in the
	  market, where you see everyone selling off a particular security and you assume, trying to view the market from someone else's
	  perspective, that you should sell too:

		-: Kripke structures

	  and normal fluctuations in the price of stock.

	- let's say a market enters a limit state and a trading pause. during this trading pause if no trades are executed the previous
	  reference price, before the pause, will be reinstated. in terms of mechanics, if there actually was a large fluctuation in the price
	  of a stock one would imagine no trades occuring during the inital pause. if the previous reference price is reinstated, bids or offers
	  will slip towards the previous price bands

		-: slippage: if I'm willing to pay $95 for a stock I'd also be willing to pay $94 for a stock / if I'm willing to sell for
			     $95 I'm also willing to sell for $100

	  and another trading pause will occur, effectively locking the security until, say, the exchange can figure out what is going on

	  if trades do occur during the trading pause, the average of these trades will generate the new agreed upon value for the security
	  i.e. the reference price

	- if you have a number of bids and offers, the average of the two can be thought of as the actual value of the security

		-: let's say you have 3 bids and 3 offers:

					bid				offer
					$95				$120
					$115				$116
					$94				$116

		    would the actual value simply be the average of these values? (95 + 94 + 115 + 120 + 116 + 116)/6 = 109.33

		    if you're using some notion of a reference price, you might eliminate the bid of $115; this might be artificially increasing
		    the value of the stock so you could eliminate it since it's (probably) outside the price bands.

	- if you have 1 bid for $10 and 100 offers for $100, is the actual value of the stock closer to $100 or $10?

		- intuition says it'd be closer to $100: (100*100 + 10)/101 = $99.11. However, if you only have a single person bidding for a
		  security it's a buyer's market. If any of the 100 offers lowers their price they'll be more likely to actually execute their
		  trade. This might enter into the realm of game theory at that point. The value of the security will actually be closer to $10.

	- whenever you're given multiple bids and offers for securities, take their average to come up with an idea of the actual value of the stock.

	- two die rolls add up to 7. In terms of counting: 36 possibilities | {(1 + 6), (2 + 5), (3 + 4), (4 + 3), (5 + 2), (6 + 1)} = 1/6

	- P(A || B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A && B)		// overlap

	- (12/52) = (3/13) * (3/13)

	- (12/52) * (11/51)

	- a couple things to think about: product of two even numbers = even, even * odd = even, odd * odd = odd. so you'd have to get odd on the first
	  roll and odd on the second: (1/2) * (1/2) | (1/2)^3

	- I don't think so. For example, let's say you know B*R = odd. in this case, you know both B and R have to be odd numbers s.t. (B + R) = 
	  {1, 4, 6, 8, 10}. so you've constricted the solution space by half.

	- (1/2) * 6 + (1/10) * 15 = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 | 7.5

	- if the random variables are not independent: P(Y = 1|X = 1) = 1	-> (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/4) | (1/2) * [(1/2) * (1/2) + (1/2)] = (1/2) * (3/4) = 3/8
