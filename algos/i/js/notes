-: NBB:	the highest bid for a particular security

-: NBO: the lowest offer for a particular security

-: limit state:

	- this'll occur when the NBO equals the lower price band or the NBB equals the upper price band.
	  so, you have these bands for stocks, which represent bids that can be executed. If the NBO equals
	  the lower price band without crossing a bid, it means the price of the stock has dropped dramatically --
	  essentially the bids and offers have fallen outside the ranges of the price band, meaning there shouldn't
	  be anything executable.

	- overall, this simply represents that there has been substantial movement in a stock price representing volatility.
	  when this happens, no new reference prices will be calculated, which means all bids/offers that are still outside
	  the bands won't be executed. 

		- if no trading occurs for more than 15 seconds, a 5-minute trading pause will be enacted. 

	- I think of this simply as a buffer against knee-jerk reactions in the market, kind of how if the market has lost
	  a large number of points in a single day it'll close early -- giving people more time prevents panic/hasty decisions
	  that could negatively affect the market. 

-: pro-forma reference prices

	- the reference price for a stock will fluctuate over the day. Let's say, for example, after 5 minutes the reference
	  price is $50.00 (based on 3 trades of $49, $50, $51). This reference price has to remain static for at least 30 seconds. 
	  let's say in the upcoming minute there're 3 trades for $52. the new reference price will be $51 -- this differs from the
	  original reference price > %1.
