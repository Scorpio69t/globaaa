-: basics

	- a bid: order to buy
	- an offer: order to sell

-: Plan (to handle extraordinary volatility)

	-: how would a participant comply with the plan? 

		- "each participant will take such actions ... to fulfill the functions set forth in the plan"

		- offer up a member to serve on an operating committee

	-: "The Processor for each NMS stock shall calculate and disseminate to the public a
	    Lower Price Band and an Upper Price Band during Regular Trading Hours for such NMS Stock. (pg. 8)"

		- the price band shall be based on a reference price = the arithmetic mean of eligible transactions of
		  the stock over the preceding 5 minute period.

		- if no transactions have occurred over this 5 minute period, the previous arithmetic mean preceding
		  this 5 minute period will be maintained

		- you'll be given percentage parameters, which should vary throughout the day, and the:

			- lower price band: percentage parameter below the reference price
			- upper price band: percentage parameter above the reference price

		- so, for example, let's say the arithmetic mean of transactions over the preceding 5 minutes is 3 dollars 
		  a stock with a percentage parameter = 10%. the price bands would then be [2.70, 3.30].

		- between 9:30 - 9:45 and 3:35 - 4, percentage parameters will be double whatever they are set forth as.

		- reopening price: price of a transaction following a trading pause / regulatory halt

		- "If a Pro-Forma Reference Price has not moved by 1% or more from the Reference Price currently in effect, no
		  new Price Bands shall be disseminated" (pg. 8)

		- Except when a Regulatory Halt is in effect at the start of regular trading hours, the first Reference Price 
		  for a trading day shall be the Opening Price on the Primary Listing Exchange in an NMS Stock if such Opening 
		  Price occurs less than five minutes after the start of regular trading hours.
