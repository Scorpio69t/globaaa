	solution:

		take 2 groups of 3 balls and weigh them:

			if they weigh the same, take a group of 4 balls and weigh these against 4 balls from the
			initial 2 groups. if they weigh the same, easy to find faulty ball in last 2

			


take another three and weigh those against an initial group. 

				if this third groups's weight equals the first group's, the faulty ball is in 
				the final group. from this 4th group, take 2 balls and and weigh them with
				any of the original 2 groups.

	clue is that it's kind of binary search ->

		take 2 groups of 4, weigh them.

			1) if they equal eachother, the weighted ball must be in the other group of 4

			2) if they don't equal each other, measure against the other group of 4 to determine
			   the group containing the weighted ball. this should also tell you whether the ball is 
			   lighter or heavier

		start with 2 groups of 4:

			if they're equal, it's in the 3rd group

				take 2 balls from the initial 2 -> and 2 from new group

					1) if they match, take one from last group -- should be able to tell if it's lighter
					   or heavier

					2) if they don't match, it's in that group of 2

			if they don't equal, take 2 balls from the third group and 2 from each of the two groups:

				if they match

			3 and 3; if they equal, take another 3, if they equal you know it's in the 4th 3: take 2 balls from this and 
			add them to the first 3 and 3, should be able to tell by which way the graph goes if a ball is heavier or lighter
			if no movement, it's the last ball

			3 and 3; if they aren't equal, take another 3 to find which triple is off. once you have this triple do the same as
			above: take 2 balls from the faulty group of 3 and weigh it with the group of 3 you know. if these groups of 4
			are off you know the faulty ball.

	5 and 5 -- if they're equal, it's easy

	if they aren't equal take 3 from each group and reweigh. if they're equal
