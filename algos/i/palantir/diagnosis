:- problem solving:

	: compiler
		: tasked with writing a program to translate from Pyret to Ocaml
		: hopefully this compilation would be faster than Pyret to JS
		: additionally, we hoped that during this compilation we'd be able to project
		  Ocaml's type system over Pyret, providing a faster, type safe language

		: tasked with initially researching project.

			: able to convert to Ocaml, but couldn't reuse Ocaml's type system. Trouble came from
			  the fact that everything in Pyret has to be upcast to a unitype in Ocaml, using something
			  like a wrapper, in order to get the same kind of functionality in Pyret

				: heterogenous lists
				: overloaded operators
				: etc

		: re-examined the problem

			: the speed increase was definitely a plus
			: in addition, if we spent the time constructing our own type inference system we'd have more
			  control

				: for example, only give type information in certain instances, such as function calls
				  and pattern matching (since in Pyret you have to define the type of structure you're	
				  pattern matching on)

					: benefits to this: limits the number of errors users get, which is good.
							    as a beginner programming language, you don't want to
							    flood newbies with a bunch of type information right off the
							    bat -- provides too high a barrier for entry

							    if we only infer type in a few instances, it cuts down on speed
							    loss due to running ti a lot

							    for function calls, only infer type when a value is used

		: after some work, we decided to think more about the pedagogy of things: infer type solely off of unit test
		  then type check the program off of this contract, constructed from unit tests

				: interesting that so much is dependent on unit tests

	: as preceptor
		: choosing not to fire employee; same story as before

:- about palantir

	: like their humanitarian efforts
		: using data, but providing it to people to use
			: gotham, foundry, contour, slate

:- diagnosis

	: importing a file / graph and getting an error

		1) first, check the error file or log file. anything interesting here?

		2) could what you're im ...

	: logging in

	    :: Determine if it's a single client's problem or something more widespread

		** ask for what happpened **
		** ask for the error message, error code, and any logs **

		1) make sure there is a connection to the internet. 
			: can you log onto the internet from another application?

		2) have you ever connected remotely to this address before? if so, when?
		   has anything changed on your system since then? are you inputing your
		   credentials the same as before?

		3) is a coworker close by? can you if they can connect remotely? (assuming the system doesn't use
		   asymmetric key cryptography)
			: trying to determine if this issue is localized to your machine,
			  or it might be more widespread.

	    :: Let's say the user said yes to (2), let's try to figure out what's changed. Even
	       if the user said no, perhaps there are certain configuration issues

		4) is it a firewall issue?
			: Do you have a firewall running? If so, can you disable is and
			  try connecting again?

		4.1) what version of the software are you running?
			: if it's not the latest verion, let's update and then continue.

		5) if you're using a name, maybe the resolution isn't working.
			: are you trying to connect remotely to the name of a site
			  as opposed to an IP address? If so, can you perhaps put me on
			  with a member of the technical staff near you. I want them to
			  check a host or DNS file to make sure the name you're trying 
			  to connect to is resolving to the correct IP address.

			: you can check this by pinging the IP address and the host name
			  separately. if the former goes through and not the latter, it might
			  be an issue in the resolution. Pinging the latter should also give you
			  and IP address. Does it match the IP address you're trying to connect to?

		6) the server is going to be listening on certain ports. for example, if you're
		   trying to ssh to a remote server, the remote server will likely be listening
		   on port 22. remote desktops usually listen on 3389.
			: can you get someone from the technical team to check what port you're
			  trying to connect to when you perform this remote connection?

			: you can use something like netcat to check if a port is open on
			  a remote server. if it's not and that's what you're trying to 
			  connect to, it's a problem

		7) It might be an encryption / authentication issue.
			: if you're using shh, have you shared your public key with the
			  remote server?

			: don't tell me! but in your ssh file do you have a private key that
			  maps to your public key?

		8) permissions?

	: using an API

		1) TODO
