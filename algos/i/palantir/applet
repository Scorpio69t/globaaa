- the question was: I'm trying to move something into a java applet but I can't do it. if I give it the path it works, though. help.

	: first question: has anything changed on your system recently? His response was "like what?"
	  to which I responded "like a change in firewall". He responded "no", but this was on the right path.
	  
	  it turned out that an administrator had emailed the previous week and had everyone change to root status,
	  which apparently prohibited the dragging and dropping of icons into the applet. Be more inquisitive.

	: it's good to first determine the scope of the problem. if one person is having trouble using something on
	  their system, try to figure out the extent of the problem: on the user level? the local level? system level? higher?

	: he liked it when I asked if a coworker could come over, log on, and drag and drop/ you could drag and drop on
	  a coworker's computer.

		: what does this tell you? if a coworker comes over and can drag and drop items on your computer, that points
		  to a user issue : -> something with your user credentials differs from that of your coworker's. if their
		  credentials don't work either, then it's a problem with the system. 

			- difference between user in the applet and system user **

-: Outline

	0) Always ask for error messages, logs, etc.

	1) Has anything changed with the system recently that you can think of? Firewall? An Update? A message from a system's admin?
	   A change in user credentials or policy? has anything changed from the time you were last able to use the system to now?

	2) Determine the scope of the problem:

		- can a coworker come over, log onto the applet and see if it works? can you log onto a coworker's computer and see
		   if it works? the former points to a user problem. the latter points to a local (computer) problem.

			- if it's a user problem, it seems like it has to be something related to permissions/credentials
			- a computer problem points to a configuration issue.

	3) Once you've determined the scope of the problem, try to come up with an exhaustive list of things that might go wrong at that
	   level and eliminate them one by one.

-: client - server based:

	- can't connect; error can't connect to dispatch server (gives IP address)

	- have been able to connect before; last time last week:

		- software upgrade over the weekend; upgrade server

		- run into same issue 10.0.100.0:3833

		- dispatch server list
		- port = "3833"
		- password = "palantir's own authentication"
		- additional manual stuff; done some manual stuff

		- walk use through what they're doing; special about this particular machine? every time you ask a question
		  rule something out but don't revisit.
