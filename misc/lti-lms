-: Sense is a tool provider; the MOOC is the tool consumer

-: Hidden code we run in CodeBoard's sandbox

	- is this code we've put there? is this with help from Christian?

	- how do we correlate anonymous variables in the Codeboard sandbox with
	  identifiers from the tool consumer (MOOC)?

-: What's the sequence of actions? Imagine I'm a student, what is the sequence of actions i
   have to take?

	1) i write my code in codeboard and press submit

	2) this generates an anonymous id in the codeboard sandbox
		- no, they get an anonymous id from the tool consumer. codeboard then uses
		  this id locally

	3) codeboard can forward the submission, along with this id, to Sense. we can
	   thus correlate user submissions to the tool consumer with submissions to RA

	4) what is the copy / paste method? how does a student know their own anonymous id?
	   is it not returned to the user from the tool consumer?

-: In the email about linking a Sense project with codeboard, you say you copy the 
   LTI key and secret, pasting it into codeboard's LTI settings. Is this necessary?
   Are these public/private keys specific to user or assignment? Do users have to do this
   multiple times?
