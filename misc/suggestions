- be more granular in highlighting patterns

	: so, for example, I want to find all patterns like:

		bmi = float(input("Enter your BMI: "))

	  so basically I want to know all submissions that simply ask for the user's BMI.
	  However, I think this instead matches on float(input()) or rather, singular float(input())
	  patterns

- why does it sometimes move the placement of groups? For example, if I add feedback for a particular group,
  it moves that group to the top? Why not always order it based on size of group?

- can I easily tell it to learn two patterns simultaneously?
