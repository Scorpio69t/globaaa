procs:
	
	1)	can I call do_waitpid, looping over the init process' child list, in kmain's initproc_run?

	2)	let's say I cancel a thread before it starts to run. will this come into effect after it is dequeued
		from the kt_runq but before it is actually run or is this considered something along the lines of deferred
		cancellation? In this case, should I only check if a thread has been cancelled when it wakes up i.e. switches
		back into sched_switch()? I don't understand how it would work in the former case since we wouldn't actually
		be in the thread's context to call something like kthread_exit().

VFS:

	1) why are my files from last semester crashing at apic_init()?

	2) why does having COMPLETED() in dir_namev() and lookup() change the string buffer passed in?
	   what should the type of name be so that the memory isn't overwritten? (I think this is what's
	   happening)

	3) crashes when cat'ing zero?
