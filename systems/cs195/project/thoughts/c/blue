-: using only a limited formulation, where we don't label the people, but instead have groups determined by
   the number of blue/nonblue people there are in a world is not a kripke structure. the TA said it might
   work for blue eyes, but if you consider the beliefs/possibilities between worlds, they aren't symmextric,
   meaning there can't be an equivalence, which is important in determining what people know in their worlds:

	-: in general, someone in a world knows something about themselves if that something is true in all 
	   the other worlds they can see into -- i.e. they can't imagine a world that's different.

-: consider the case where we have 2 people on an island, one of whom has blue eyes:

		Alice: Not blue eyes
		Bob: Blue eyes


		    A, B				    A, B
		    ___					     ___
		   |   |				    |   |
		   \   /				    \   /
		--------------            A		--------------
		|             |	    <----------->	|	     |
		| Alice: Blue |				| Alice: NB  |	X
		| Bob: Blue   |				| Bob: Blue  |
		|_____________|				|____________|

			^					^
			|					|
			|					|
		     B	|				     B	|
			|					|
			V					V
		--------------            A		--------------
		|             |	    <----------->	|	     |
		| Alice: Blue |				| Alice: NB  |
		| Bob: NB     |				| Bob: NB    |
		|_____________|				|____________|
		     /  \				     /  \
		    |    |				    |    |
		     \__/				     \__/
		     A, B				      A, B		

-: notice how the edges represent knowledge between worlds. also notice how the edges are symmetric. nobody
   knows what world they are actually in, since there are edges (possibilities) going to other worlds; so each
   person in these worlds can see other, different worlds that make them doubt.
	
-: now let's assume the world with the X is the actual world. When the Guru says "I see someone with blue eyes"
   we can parse the kripke structure to:

		    A, B				    A, B
		    ___					     ___
		   |   |				    |   |
		   \   /				    \   /
		--------------            A		--------------
		|             |	    <----------->	|	     |
		| Alice: Blue |				| Alice: NB  |	X
		| Bob: Blue   |				| Bob: Blue  |
		|_____________|				|____________|

			^					
			|					
			|					
		     B	|				     
			|					
			V					
		-------------- 
		|             |	    
		| Alice: Blue |	 Y			
		| Bob: NB     |				
		|_____________|				
		     /  \				     
		    |    |				    
		     \__/				     
		     A, B				      

-: how do we parse the tree further, though? if we only have self loops, this represents the knowledge of someone. so
   in X, Bob can only see the world where he has Blue eyes and Alice doesn't. likewise, in Y Alice can only see the world 
   where she has Blue eyes and Bob doesn't.

	-: self loop + actually true world means someone leaves? in X, Bob only sees the world where they have blue eyes
	   and Alice does, in fact, have NB eyes, so Bob leaves since this world is true.

-: let's say you're on the second day, however. on the second day we should know that Bob 'doesn't know" their eye color,
   otherwise Bob would've left on day 1. likewise, Alice doesn't know her eye color either. the world with the 'X' is a world
   where Bob does know his eye color, so we can remove this world. the world with the 'Y' is a world where Alice knows her
   eye color, so we can remove this world as well. this only leaves:

		    A, B	
		    ___		
		   |   |	
		   \   /	
		-------------- 
		|             |
		| Alice: Blue |	
		| Bob: Blue   |				
		|_____________|				

  can we simply look at other worlds, check to see if they only have a self loop, then remove them?
