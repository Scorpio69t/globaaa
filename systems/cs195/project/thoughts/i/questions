-- you say there should be an equivalence relation between the worlds, but in many of the examples, like from 
   the notes it's clear the relations between the worlds aren't transitive. Do the edges between worlds have to
   be transitive?

-- in the piazza post, the argument for not getting rid of certain worlds is that there isn't common knowledge
   about the least number of people. but let's say there are 5 people with blue eyes; wouldn't there be common
   knowledge that at least 3 people on the island have blue eyes? what's the definition of common knowledge here?

-- Do we have to label all the people on the island? Why? How?

-- General approach:

		1) create a set of worlds of all possibilities

		2) create relations between worlds where each edge represents the knowledge of a
		   person in that world

		3) have state transitions dependent on days, where on the n'th day you can parse the graph, 
		   getting rid of all worlds w/ < n blue eyed people

			3.1) have a predicate that basically checks if on the n'th day a person can look around
			     and see n - 1 blue eyed people. if they do, they realize they also have blue eyes
			     and can leave the island.
