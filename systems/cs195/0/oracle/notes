- what is a DAG

	: DAG - directed acyclic graph. Directed means that every edge goes from one
	  vertex to another. Acyclic in that you can't follow any set of directed
	  edges from 'v' and end up back at 'v'

- topological sort

	: If a directed graph has a cycle it can't have a topological sorting.

		- let's say {a -> b -> c -> a}. I can't choose any vertex since there's
		  a vertex that comes before it.
