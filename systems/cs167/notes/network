- time wait:

	a client has to stick around for a period of time, even though it's 'closed' its connection to the server, so that if the
	server doesn't receive an acknowledgement that the connection is closed when the two parties are terminating their connections,
	the client can send again (otherwise, since you're using TCP, the server will keep trying until it gets acknowledgement from the
	client that its received its packets)

		- this is why sometimes, even after a connection is closed, you can't immediately reuse a port number (33 assignments)
