- why?: 

	- I think the idea behind a microkernel is to run a bare-bones kernel s.t. most things can run in 
	  user land (the file system, for example)
	
		- protects against problematic OS code?

	- essentially everything is handled through ports and 'send rights' and 'receive rights'.

		- need to read book on this
