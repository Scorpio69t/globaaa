- I think the big problem here is that since all interrupts are handled on the same stack things can easily 
  get clobbered. For example, let's say thread [1] gets an interrupt and switches to thread [2]. This interrupt
  in the VAX architecture is handled on the process' stack. Let's say thread [2] get's a couple of interrupts and 
  then a thread switch signal, switching back to thread [1]. Since this is all happening on the same stack, 
  any interrupts [1] gets could corrupt the stack from thread [2], overwriting what was previously pushed.
