- What I think you can do, then, is to use the request flag to request thread switch handlers to be placed
  on the thread's kernel stack instead of on the shared process' stack. When you switch back and forth between
  threads, you're switching between the stacks of the threads with other interrupt handlers being placed on
  the process' stack.

  Taking the example from above, thread [1] switches to [2]. A couple interrupts are placed on the process'
  stack before switching back to [1]. If [1] were to add interrupt handlers to the process' stack, they
  would correctly be pushed on top of the handlers already pushed on the stack by [2].
