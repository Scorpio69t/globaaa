Metadata Exfiltration:

  attack:

	So this attack isn't too difficult, I simply run:

		strings cs666_handin

	and then read the results. From this I can see that in the 'tabin' folder there's a bash
	script named '/course/cs666/tabin/autograde.sh', which basically lets me know there's an
	autograder running on all the handins. If you simply try to execute into the 'tabin' directory
	you can't, thus, the existence of this bash script should be hidden from the user. Being
	able to read the executable, however, gives me access to this info.

  fix:

	A good way to fix this would be to make cs666_handin not readable by users - this would prevent 
	me from running strings on the file and then reading the output.
