Metadata Exfiltration:

  attack:

        Whenever a user tries to hand in an assignment, the autograder will use the 'tmp' folder. Since this folder is world readable, other users can
        peak in and see when other students are submitting their homeworks. Furthermore, let's say I'm Bob and I see a file in the 'tmp' folder. If I
        run 'getfacl' on the file, I'll be able to see its owner, thus, knowing who has submitted their homework.

  fix:

	The fix for this is pretty easy, just change the permissions of the 'tmp' folder to prevent users from executing it.
