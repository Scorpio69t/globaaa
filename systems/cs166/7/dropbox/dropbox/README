We used the design in our design document except for some parts as suggested by the 
TA. For sharing, please see our comments in shares.go and fd.go. We changed 
our database structures as outlined there, providing ample comments throughout
all the code. 

After we were able to successfully abstract the file system, we tested our implementation
by working and testing edge cases in the environment, as well as adding a number of debugging 
information to the server, which would run and give us output during execution.

We had a little trouble with the very last thing we implemented. We were able to 
implement sharing and deduplication (CS162), but were still having a few bugs when
it came to shared users writing back to shared files - it's a known bug =( 

Just as a note, I've fixed all the problems above -- it should run perfectly now lol.

To run, use the address of one of the CIT machines:

	./server / mslab4b-l:1234		/* "/" base directory; "1234" port number */

	./client mslab4b-l:1234
