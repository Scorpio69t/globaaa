	Usually when there is a DDoS attack there's a sudden, high number of requests coming in a short period of time. A couple ways
	to potentially protect against this:

		1) limit the # of expensive requests that can be initiated by IP addresses. So, the key here is to only allow IP 
		   addresses to make a certain number of costly requests within a particular time frame under the assumption
		   a normal user wouldn't make more requests than this. Beyond this threshold, discard additional requests.

		2) keep track of the kinds of requests coming in to the server. So above, you were measuring the frequency of requests.
		   Now, look at the kinds of requests coming from particular IPs. Even if a computer isn't making costly requests,
		   if it makes 100s of the same request, this doesn't seem like normal user behavior and so it might be a bot
		   you'd want to block.
