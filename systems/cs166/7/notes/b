	I think the data link layer primarily identifies devices on a local area network. So, for example, let's say you're
	sending data over the LAN. You're not going to use an IP address (since this is used to identify devices on the internet)
	so instead MAC addresses for each device would identify them on the local network.

	Let's say Host A tries to send a packet to IP address: 128.148.32.12. 
	
		1) First thing to notice is that the destination of the packet is outside Host A's subnet, therefore Host A 
		   is going to have to make use of its default gateway to communicate with other networks outside of its 
		   local area. 

		2) In order to locate the router at IP 192.168.1.1, and because Host A's ARP cache is empty, A will send out broadcast 
		   address: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, which should return the MAC address of the router in Host A's subnet: 11:11:11:11:11
		   (* QUESTION: does the host need to do this even if the switch knows the locations of all the MAC addresses? *)

		3) Host A will send its packet to the router at MAC address 11:11:11:11:11. The router, whose ARP cache is also
		   empty, will try to identify a subnet to forward packet 128.148.32.12 to by sending out broadcast address FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.
		   Since none of the subnets connected to the router are of the form 128.148.32.*, it'll forward the packet along to the
		   internet IP: 138:16:118:162.
		   (* QUESTION: do routers also make use of ARP broadcasts? *)

		4) The packet will travel among routers until one finally knows the correct network to forward it to. In 
		   the case above, 128.148.32.12 refers to 'cs.brown.edu'. When I try to connect to that IP via a browser it bounces 
		   back with an empty response, which makes me think that IP address might be related to SSH'ing into Brown's CS 
		   network.
		   (* QUESTION: try visiting this IP on a machine attached to the network *)
