- So, this is probably not the best attempt for the last project. I tried to use all of the structs
  and functions supplied. I added a couple things:

	- remove_from_list: a function to find a client_t* node in the client list and refactor the pointers

	- I also added a rw_lock to the defintion of node_t in db.h

  aside from these minor changes, everything else should adhere to the basic outline.

- I think, in general, it works. If I run the server with something like 
  './client cslab3h 3355 scripts/test1.txt 10' this produces the correct output and in the correct 
  order. Sometimes, if you run this multiple times with the same server, if you increase the occurences,
  you still get the correct answer, the client, however, seems to hang at the very end. I think this
  was mentioned on Piazza but I'm not sure if it's the same error.

- I think the hardest part for me was canceling, detaching, and returning threads back to memory. Sometimes it
  was hard to tell exactly what each function did, and if it was accomplishing what I thought it was. If I had more
  time, I'd probably go back over this part of server.c and check the logic. db.c seems to work, but again, there 
  could be logic mistakes I missed.
