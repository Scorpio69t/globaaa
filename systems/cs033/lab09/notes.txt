- mmap() creates a mapping onto a virtual address space.

	- the only 2 difficult parameters to this function are the protections and
	  the flags. The 'prot' refers to whether you can read, write, execute, or
	  do nothing with this mapping. The protections for this mapping must NOT
	  CONFLICT with the permissions you gave the file with you opened it.

	- the flags can either be: MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE.

		- maybe you have to make this shared, since what memcpy is doing is
		  not necessarily copying bytes over but having dest refer to the same
		  addresses as src.

		- it might be useful to ask about this before turning in
